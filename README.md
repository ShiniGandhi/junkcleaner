# junkcleaner
a small autocleaner for your downloads folder

## what?
junkcleaner is a small python script designed to delete everything in a folder (for example downloads folder) every predefined length of time.
the script runs in the systemtray and takes little to no resources

## why?
i wanted a way to encourage myself to keep files organized.

## how?
just download the executable from the releases page and run it (not in your download folder).
you can also just run the code if you want.
the file will create a `settings.txt` file.

## notes
this code is far from perfect, there are definitely things that can be improved, so feel free to contribute
